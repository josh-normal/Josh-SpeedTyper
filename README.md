## Description

SpeedTyper is a touch typing practicing website which's idea originate from TypeRacer.com. But instead of just practicing, you can also have control of what you want to practice: add, edit, delete, and more...

For examplle if you love a lyric from All Too Well sung by Taylor Swift: "You call me up again just to break me like a promise, so casually cruel in the name of being honest.". Well now you can add it to the list of content that you can type.

You can also delete what you don't like, edit the content whenever you want, and the best part, noone will know what you added to the list because the contents if belong to you only.

## Intruction when viewing the website

When enter the practicing interface, you don't have to use mouse to click anywhere. Your cursor is already on the text. You just need to hit the Space on your keyboard to activate the 'game' and start typing.

After finishing one typing session, you can view your typing speed and the information of the content you just type.

If you want to see your history, head over to the main page and go to the "History" section where you can view your most recent 20 trial and your best 20 one.
